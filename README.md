Revolutionizing Robotics with Computer Vision and Arduino Integration at MakerNova 2024 üöÄü§ñ
I‚Äôm excited to share a  project developed with my talented team at MakerNova 2024, where we combined computer vision and Arduino-based robotics to create an intelligent, real-time object-tracking system. This collaborative effort showcases the power of integrating YOLOv8 for object detection with precise motor control, highlighting the potential of AI and embedded systems in robotics.
üîß Project Highlights  

Objective: Built a system that uses computer vision to detect and track objects in real-time, controlling a robot‚Äôs movement via an Arduino microcontroller.  
Technologies Used:  
Python: Utilized OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLO, and PySerial for vision processing and serial communication.  
Arduino: Programmed motor control using PWM signals for dynamic navigation (forward, left, right, stop).  
Hardware: Arduino board with motor drivers to execute precise movements based on visual input.



üîç How It Works  

Object Detection: A pre-trained YOLOv8 model identifies a target object (class "P") in a live video feed, calculating its bounding box and centroid.  
Decision Logic: The system analyzes the object‚Äôs position within the frame, dividing it into five zones to determine movement commands (e.g., turn left, right, or move forward).  
Arduino Communication: Commands are sent via serial communication to the Arduino, which adjusts motor speeds and directions using PWM signals for smooth navigation.  
Optimization: Implemented checks to prevent redundant commands, ensuring efficient communication and robust performance.

üí° Key Features  

Real-Time Processing: Achieves seamless object tracking with minimal latency using GPU acceleration (CUDA support).  
Dynamic Control: Adjusts motor speeds (e.g., 60 or 90 PWM) based on the object‚Äôs position for precise navigation.  
Error Handling: Robust exception handling for serial communication and video capture ensures system reliability.  
User-Friendly: Allows users to select the Arduino COM port dynamically for easy setup.

üåü Impact and ApplicationsThis project, developed during the high-energy environment of MakerNova 2024, demonstrates the synergy between AI-driven vision and embedded systems. It opens doors for applications in:  

Autonomous robotics for navigation and object tracking.  
Industrial automation for quality control and monitoring.  
Educational platforms to teach computer vision and robotics integration.
